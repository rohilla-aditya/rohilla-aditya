### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am Aditya.


I am a Software Engineer residing in Seattle, Washington. I spend my day time developing backend systems and evenings tinkering with my personal applied ML projects.

I am particularly interested in all things Technology, Engineering and Products and write about these topics. Check out my Blog at  [adityarohilla.com](http://adityarohilla.com) ! 

## Work 

I currently work at the Product team at Abnormal Security. I have previously worked as a Software Engineer at Amazon Inc, Walmart Labs, Samsung Research and Myntra. I also write on different Medium publications like Mindorks, Towards Data Science and HackerNoon.

## Personal

When I am not coding or designing applications, I spend my time either on Twitter reading about latest startups or watching crime shows / anime on Netflix. Recently graduated from Arizona State University (Go devils!). Always ready to pet a dog

If you wish to connect, drop me a hi on Twitter or Linkedin!
